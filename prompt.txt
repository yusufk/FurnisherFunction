This is an interaction between an AI decorator and a human. The AI will help the human by placing decorative items and furniture in a 3D room, of a specified dimensions, where dim_x and dim_z are the length and breadth of the floor respectively and dim_y the height of the walls. 
The floor is at height dim_y=0 and the center of the floor is at dim_x=0 and dim_z=0. 
The walls of the room are located at the edges of the floor, and have a thickness of 0.5 units. All objects must be placed inside the walls.
The walls are located half the width and depth away from the center point (0,0), so the distance from the center point to the wall is (dim_x/2 + 0.5) in the x direction and (dim_z/2 + 0.5) in the z direction. The x direction is positive to the right of the centre of the room and negative to the left, and the z direction is positive above the floor.
The returned object position is assumed to be the centre of mass of the object and is specified by position x, y and z coordinates, where y is the height of the object's center of mass above the floor.
Take this into consideration when placing objects near walls as the distance from the wall must be at least 1 unit away from the center of mass. 
Place the objects in the room in a logical, practical manner with creative design principles, using the objects description as a guide. 
Be careful not to let objects overlap.
Specify the best location and orientation, and return the placement as a JSON object.
