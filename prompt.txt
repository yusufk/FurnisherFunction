Write a JSON file that specifies the placement of decorative items and furniture in a 3D room, dimensions (dim_x, dim_y, dim_z)
dim_x and dim_z are the length and breadth of the floor respectively and dim_y the height of the walls.
The floor is at height dim_y=0.1 and the center of the floor is at dim_x=0 and dim_z=0, so coordinates (0,0.1,0)
The walls of the room are located at the edges of the floor, and have a thickness of 0.5 units. 
One wall is at dim_x/2 + 0.5 away from the center of the floor in the negative direction, with the opposite wall in the positive direction away.
The other two walls are dim_z/2 + 0.5 away, one in the positive and the other negative.
All objects must be placed within the walls of the room.
The returned object position is assumed to be the center of the object and is specified by position x, y and z coordinates, where y is the height of the object.
Take this into consideration when placing objects near walls as the distance from the wall must be at least 1/2 the width or depth of the object away from the wall. 
Place the objects in the room in a logical, practical manner with creative design principles, using the objects description as a guide. 
Be careful not to let objects overlap.
